#Treehouse FSJS Project 7

Uses Express to interface with Twitter API

## To Do:
### Dependency Management
- [x] Project includes a package.json file containing dependencies to run the project
- [ ] Running npm install installs relevant dependencies

### Server-Side API Access
- [ ] Correctly uses an API key and secret from Twitter to communicate on the server.
- [ ] Application can be authenticated using a config.js file, and contains code allowing a config.js file to be imported into app.js

### Correct Express Routes
- [ ] Renders a template with the user’s Twitter info using the ‘/’ route

### Rendered Template
- [ ] Matches the sample layout: a header and three columns of data as shown.

### Displays Correct Information
- [ ] Displays 5 tweets, 5 friends, and username in a Jade/Pug template that roughly matches the mockups
- [ ] App should try to display 5 direct messages, but if there aren't 5 direct messages available to display, It's okay to show fewer, as long as the app doesn't crash as a result of it.
